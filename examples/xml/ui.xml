<!--
    Azuls rendering model is based on composing DOMs together (instead of doing that by
    extending classes like in object-oriented GUI frameworks). As such, each "component"
    simply corresponds to a Rust function, such as `fn render_component_start_screen() -> Dom<T>`.

    Each "component" has two arguments: a mandatory "name" and an optional "args".
    The "name" argument is both used for instantiating the component and, in the XML-to-Rust
    transpiler to generate the function names.

    Note: All component names and arguments are normalized to kebap_case, i.e. "<StartScreen />"
    and "<start_screen />" are equivalent, but "<Startscreen />" will lead to an error.
-->
<component name="StartScreen">
    <div id="start_screen">
        <div id="last_projects_column">
             <p id="last_projects_header">
                You can hot-reload this UI, see /examples/ui.xml.

                If you want to insert a return in this text, you"ll have to use two line breaks,
                a single linebreak is ignored (and rendered as a space instead).
             </p>
             <div id="project_btn_container">
                <p id="new_project_btn">+</p>
                <p id="open_project_btn">Open project</p>
             </div>
        </div>
        <div id="map_preview_container">
            <div id="map_preview" />
            <Calendar selectedDate="01.01.2019" minimumDate="test2"/>
        </div>
    </div>
</component>

<!--
    The (optional) "args" argument takes a comma-separated list in the form of "variable_name: type".

    During hot-reloading, this indicates which arguments are needed by the component. If a user tries
    to instantiate a "<TestComponent asdf="true" />", he'll get an error that "asdf" is not a valid
    component (function) argument. The type is not used at runtime, the XML reloader assumes passes
    all arguments around as strings, it is only used for generating the Rust code. If the component
    uses a variable that was not declared in the "args", the variable is simply displayed as a "{variableName}" -
    and the generated Rust code will lead to a compile error.

    In the generated Rust code, the "args" map directly to function arguments. You can also format
    variables and pass them to sub-components (which in the Rust code will map to calls to "format!()").
    In order to display a brace during formatting, use two braces, i.e.:

    "{{ selectedDate }}" => "{ selectedDate }"
    "{selectedDate}" => "01.01.2019" (variable name replaced by argument).

    You can use formatting in ids, classes, etc. - as well as the node content, i.e
    "<SubComponent id="{componentId}" /> will look for the "componentId" variable.

    <StartScreen />
    <!-- Note that "minimumDate" is missing, so the string will just be rendering as "{minimumDate}" -->
